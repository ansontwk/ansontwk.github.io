My research focus in microbial genomics, bioinformatics and novel deep learning methods. Most of what you will see here will revolve around these topics.

I mainly code in Python through Visual studio code, and R through R studio. 
For machine learning tasks, I tend to gravitate towards tensorflow. 
My work is usually on a Linux Ubuntu workstation and I manage my environments using conda.
